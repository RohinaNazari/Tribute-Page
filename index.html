        <h2>Biography</h2>
           <p class="bio">Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, to Maye (n√©e Haldeman), 
            a model, and Errol Musk, a businessman and engineer. Musk briefly attended the 
            University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at the age of 18, acquiring 
            citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later he matriculated 
            at Queen's University at Kingston in Canada. Musk later transferred 
            to the University of Pennsylvania and received bachelor's degrees in economics
             and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University, 
             but dropped out after two days and, with his brother Kimbal, co-founded 
             the online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired 
             by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. That same year Musk co-founded X.com, 
             a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. 
             In October 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion. 
             Using $100 million of the money he made from the sale of PayPal, Musk 
            founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company, in 2002.</p>
